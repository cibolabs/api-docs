# Leaflet Demo

## Obtaining a token

A token needs to be obtained as described in the [Quickstart](../quickstart.md). The website
requests this token when opened.

A `property_id` is also needed but this is set to a default value for testing.

## To run locally

Open a terminal in this directory and run the following command:

```
python3 -m http.server
```

Then in a browser, navigate to [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/). Changes to your code
are reloaded when you refresh.
